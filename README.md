## Contact section
I made it responsive and added logging the data after submitting.
I didn't add the phone number to be checked by length because it depends on the country.

## Image component
I added lazy loading to save memory (feature section seems not to lazy load and it is because it's very close to the top of the page and loader detects it as visible)
Also added error handling to make the size of the placeholder be the same as img. It makes the rest of the content stay where it should be.

I did not fix the rest of page as requested.
