## Contact section

I made it to be resonsive and logging the data after submit.

I didn't add phone number to be checked by length becouse it depends on country.

## Image component

I added lazy loading to save memory (feature section seams not to lazy load, it is because it's' very close to the top of page and loader detects it as visible)
Also error handling to make size of placeholder be same as img. It makes the rest of content to stay where it should be.

I did not fix the rest of page as requested.
